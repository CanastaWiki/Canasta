A full-featured MediaWiki stack for easy deployment of enterprise-ready MediaWiki on production environments.

Note: This repo is a fork of the MediaWiki application Docker image included in the Canasta stack.
For complete documentation on the overall Canasta tech stack, including installation instructions,
please visit https://github.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta-Documentation. Note,
however, that parts of that documentation do not apply to using Taqasta.

# Differences from Canasta

While this repo is a fork of Canasta and shares substantial similarities, there
are a number of places where Taqasta's behavior differents from Canasta's

* Taqasta bundles a lot more extensions and skins, allowing you to enable them
on your wiki without needing to download them separately.
* Taqasta does not support running multiple wikis at the same time as a farm.
* Taqasta makes much greater use of environmental variables to read
configuration, which can be used for everything from enabling email and upload
to adding extensions and skins.
* Taqasta also uses environmental variables to allow configuring the admin and
database accounts, allowing the installer to run as part of the container
setup rather than needing to install the wiki manually - with Canasta, you
need to manually go through the MediaWiki installation process, while Taqasta
will perform it automatically. This is especially helpful if you want to copy
the configuration of an existing wiki.

Note that the WikiTeq team, which maintains Taqasta, also maintains a dedicated
branch of Canasta that is much more closely aligned with Canasta but includes
various extensions and other tweaks that the WikiTeq team uses.
