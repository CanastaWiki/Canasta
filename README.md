# CanastaBase
A MediaWiki stack for easy deployment of enterprise-ready MediaWiki on production environments.

This repository is for the Docker image CanastaBase, which, as its name implies, serves as the base image for the Canasta Docker image. It includes all of the Canasta functionality except for extensions and skins, and a few extensions' related scripts. CanastaBase can also easily be used as a base image for any other Canasta-like MediaWiki distribution, which can then apply its own set of extensions, scripts and utilities.

For complete documentation on the overall Canasta tech stack, including installation instructions, please visit https://github.com/CanastaWiki/Canasta-Documentation or https://canasta.wiki/.
